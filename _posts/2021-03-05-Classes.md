Adding dynamic classes to HTML elements.

## How it works

If you need to dynamically add a class to an HTML element, there are three options:

### [class.class-name]="statement"

With this method, all you have to do, is have a true/false statement, that if returns true, the class will be added; if not, the class will not be added.

```html
[class.active]="isActive"
```
