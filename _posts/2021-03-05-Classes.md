## [class.class-name]="statement"

With this method, all you have to do, is have a true/false statement, that if returns true, the class will be added; if not, the class will not be added.

```html
<div [class.active]="isActive">Is Active</div>
```

## [ngClass]="{ active: i == 0 }"

This method is slightly overcomplicated, but the main benefit is that you can have multiple classes in one statement:

```html
<div [ngClass]="{ active: i == 0, inactive: i != 0 }">Is Active</div>
```

With this, you can add as many classes as you want in one funtion.

## [ngClass]="editItem.id === item.id ? 'active' : 'inactive'"

This one is useful if you want to add different classes for the true value AND the false value.

```html
<div [ngClass]="id === '1' ? 'active' : 'inactive'">Is Active</div>
```
