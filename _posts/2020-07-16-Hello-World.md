Finally, I have a blog set up.

Hello World

I decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host this blog. It's very easy and mostly automated, and it allows me to focus on content, rather than the hosting and layout. I've created a simple theme for that reason.

I definitely recommend checking out [**barryclark/jekyll-now**](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to get started if you're interested in doing the same.
