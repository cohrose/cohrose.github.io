Having trouble with `switchMap()` since you have to wait for each Observable to finish before it starts the next? Look no further! zip() is the answer!

## What does zip() do?

zip() takes as many Observables as you want, and runs them back to back, without waiting on any of the calls to be resolved.

```js
this.input.valueChanges
    .pipe(
       switchMap(() => zip(this.firstCall(), this.secondCall())),
       tap(() => (this.pending = false)),
    )
.subscribe(),
```

With this, the calls run simultaneously, so you must be sure that the second call doesn't depend on the first call's response.
